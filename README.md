The MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Blog App is a web application designed to facilitate the creation, management, and sharing of blog posts. This project utilizes the MERN stack, a popular choice for building dynamic and scalable web applications. The application allows users to register, create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as comment on posts. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless and intuitive platform for both bloggers and readers to engage with content.
